Title: MolE molecular embeddings
Description: MolE is a foundation model for chemistry developed by Recursion. It combines
  geometric deep learning with transformers, to learn a meaningful representation
  of molecules. MolE leverages extensive labeled and unlabeled datasets in two pretraining
  steps. First it follows a novel self-supervised strategy using the graph representation
  of ~842 million molecules designed to properly learn to represent chemical structures.
  It is followed by a massive multi-task training to assimilate biological information.
